# Euphemisms attenuate norm violations: an EEG study

# Project Description
This repository contains the data analysis code used in the study of neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the perception of euphemized descriptions of norm violations. The study utilized ERP components (N400, P600) to examine brain responses to euphemisms and non-euphemized terms.

# Study Goals
Investigate how euphemisms influence behavioral evaluations and brain activity.
Explore differences in ERP components for euphemized and non-euphemized descriptions.
Assess the role of individual cognitive traits in the perception of euphemisms.

# Key Findings
Behavioral Results: Euphemisms reduced the perceived severity of norm violations.
ERP Results:
P600 was more pronounced for non-euphemized descriptions.
N400 showed no significant differences between conditions.
Individual Differences: No significant correlation was found between Need for Cognition and responses to euphemisms.
