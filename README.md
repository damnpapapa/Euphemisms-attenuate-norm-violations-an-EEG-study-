# **Euphemisms Attenuate Norm Violations: An EEG Study**

## **Project Description**
This repository contains the data analysis code and supplementary materials for the study on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the perception of euphemized norm violations. The study used ERP components (N400, P600) to examine how euphemisms influence brain responses and behavioral evaluations.

### **Study Goals**
- Explore how euphemisms affect the perception of norm violations.  
- Examine differences in ERP components (N400 and P600) for euphemized and non-euphemized descriptions.  
- Investigate the influence of individual cognitive traits (Need for Cognition) on these processes.
